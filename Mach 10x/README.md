This software runs the tele-operated and autonomous programs for the 24" cube
robot.This source code contains many standard functions to operate a chassis,
lift, and claw and/or intake. Aside from that, it contains functions that create
paths for the robot to follow (using the okapi library).

When this software is released, as early as May 2020, it will be meant for
teaching purposes. Parts of this source code can be used for your needs, keeping
in mind that the main purpose of the software is to get Vex competitors familiar
with the PROS API and see how the PROS API can be applied.
