These repositories contain the software needed to run the robots.

Mach 10s: 15" Robot
Mach 10x: 24" Robot

These repositories contain many standard functions to operate a chassis,
lift, and claw (and/or intake) of our VexU robots. Aside from that, it contains
functions that create paths for the robots to follow (using the okapi library).

When this software is released, it will be meant for teaching purposes. Parts of
this source code can be used for your needs, keeping in mind that the main purpose
of the software is to get Vex competitors familiar with the PROS API and see how
the PROS API can be applied.
