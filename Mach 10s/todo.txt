add all capabilities of profile controller to path.cpp and add special cases
such as going forward and back to drive.cpp

for UI:
work on gui to have the following features:
autonomous selector
show sensor values


for path:
generate critical paths at startup and create the rest in a separate thread to decrease wait
time. depending on how long it takes to generate them.
maybe store paths to reuse


for chassis:
make robot turn based on a constant acceleration that removes drift, base on time,
not encoder counts for the start

for lift: none found

for intake: none found

mechanical things that impact auto:
chain may skip over middle sprocket; fixed?                  n
Reasoning: reduces wheel slop not detected by IME's
sprocket and wheel need to be screwed together; done?        n
Reasoning: reduces wheel slop not detected by IME's
wheels need to have screwed in rollers; done?                n
Reasoning: prevents robot moving sideways, improving accuracy.

for branch
what i wanna do
i wanna have a pointer to object on the already created profile controller
to reference in the autonomous functions
problems:
datatype is auto
if i change it to motionProfile i get out of scope errors
cant make a class, other files use those functions and they're convenient

what if:
i make a class but it is initialized already
but then theres no substancial advantage
end

ez solution: change from auto datatype, move verbosity but no big deal
