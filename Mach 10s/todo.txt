changed the turn to a PD control that inputs a struct of gains that contain the gains
for the PID turn.

implemented lvgl to have the temperature of the motors show as well as the
battery level.

added an initialize method in the chassis namespace

all of this is more experimental and has to be merged with the 15_inch branch
with the features added and implement them to all the subsystems that need them
